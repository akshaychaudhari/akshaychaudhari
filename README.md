### Hello!

I'm a full-stack software engineer with 5 years of experience.

My journey began with noodling on web, building simple web app during my undergrad, bachelors degree in computer science from Pune University, kick-starting my passion for building and delivering quality software at scale.

Since then, I’ve architected, designed, and implemented **10+** software applications, with a focus on helping software users and developers discover great options to collaborate to solve real world problems and level-up their skills.

<!-- As of 2024, I have earned masters degree in computer science**.

Here are a handful I’m most proud of:

- Architected, designed, and developed an chat box SaaS application with 15+ features including an advanced chat editor, sentimental analytics, embeddable sign-up forms, and more.

- Independently developed and scaled a web application capable of over a million users.

- Built the Theme Studio for VS Code - It reached #1 on Hacker News and continues to delight thousands of software developers each month. I replicated the entire VS Code interface with plain-old CSS (and lots of coffee).

- Helped over 3,000,000+ software engineers research and discover great open source resources through the various websites I've created.

- Trained hundreds of developers on advanced usage of VS Code through an online course, with an average **4.7 stars** rating.
